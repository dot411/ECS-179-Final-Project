## Summary ##

An action horror game set in a dark and eerie Victorian-era Gothic mansion, where your primary goal is to escape the nightmarish environment. As the game begins, you wake up alone in a dimly lit room, disoriented and with no recollection of how you arrived. The unsettling silence is broken only by distant, chilling noises, setting the tone for the terrifying journey ahead. Driven by a mix of fear and curiosity, you start to explore the shadowy corridors and decrepit streets, only to discover that the place is teeming with hostile, "infected" individuals who are out for blood. To survive, you must navigate a labyrinth of interconnected rooms, passageways, and outdoor areas, all while solving puzzles, using weapons, and piecing together the mansionâ€™s dark secrets. The infected are relentless, and your limited supply of resources forces you to make tough decisions: do you risk engaging them head-on, or attempt to sneak past unnoticed?

**A paragraph-length pitch for your game.**

Resident Medieval is a pulse-pounding action-horror game where you must navigate a sinister mansion teeming with infected enemies, solve cryptic puzzles, and make life-or-death decisions to survive the night. Action-horror games often focus on combat or stealth, but Resident Medieval blends both with a resource-constrained survival element and intricate environmental puzzles. There is always constant tension between engaging enemies and sneaking past them adds a unique, strategic layer to the gameplay. Jump into the action and give it a try!

## Gameplay Explanation ##

Controls are WASD to move, shift to run, E to interact, left click to use weapon, I for inventory, #1-9 to select inventory slot. Interact with cabinets to obtain items. In some rooms, enemies will be constantly spawned from spawners, so running from them is a valid way to play the game. In terms of weaponry, there is a knife which is unlimited and a pistol which takes ammo. There are three times of enemies, normal melee zombies, ranged zombies, and slasher zombies which are slightly stronger. Enemy AI gets alerted by player and follows player through ray casting. The first puzzle is a room where you have to interact with the cabinets in a certain order to unlock the door. There will be a hint based on the text (2:00 then 5:00) and the clock pattern on the carpet. When at the second puzzle, the player notices that there is no door for the next room. The player must interact with the matches on a cabinet to burn away the firewood in the fireplace to unlock a passage.

NOTE: You aim by your mouse position (even your knife).

**In this section, explain how the game should be played. Treat this as a manual within a game. Explaining the button mappings and the most optimal gameplay strategy is encouraged.**

Optimal strategy would be a mix of fighting and running when you get overwhelmed by enemies. As mentioned, the you can select items in your inventory by using the the 1-9 keys. Save your pistol for tough enemies since you will only receive a small amount of ammo. Switch to your knife on weaker enemies since the knife can be used without any cost. Finally, run by holding the shift key in short bursts to make sure you do not get fatigued. The health and fatigue bar can be viewed at the top-left of the screen.

**Add it here if you did work that should be factored into your grade but does not fit easily into the proscribed roles! Please include links to resources and descriptions of game-related material that does not fit into roles here.**

# External Code, Ideas, and Structure #

If your project contains code that: 1) your team did not write, and 2) does not fit cleanly into a role, please document it in this section. Please include the author of the code, where to find the code, and note which scripts, folders, or other files that comprise the external contribution. Additionally, include the license for the external code that permits you to use it. You do not need to include the license for code provided by the instruction team.

If you used tutorials or other intellectual guidance to create aspects of your project, include reference to that information as well.

# Main Roles #

Your goal is to relate the work of your role and sub-role in terms of the content of the course. Please look at the role sections below for specific instructions for each role.

Below is a template for you to highlight items of your work. These provide the evidence needed for your work to be evaluated. Try to have at least four such descriptions. They will be assessed on the quality of the underlying system and how they are linked to course content. 

*Short Description* - Long description of your work item that includes how it is relevant to topics discussed in class. [link to evidence in your repository](https://github.com/dr-jam/ECS189L/edit/project-description/ProjectDocumentTemplate.md)

Here is an example:  
*Procedural Terrain* - The game's background consists of procedurally generated terrain produced with Perlin noise. The game can modify this terrain at run-time via a call to its script methods. The intent is to allow the player to modify the terrain. This system is based on the component design pattern and the procedural content generation portions of the course. [The PCG terrain generation script](https://github.com/dr-jam/CameraControlExercise/blob/513b927e87fc686fe627bf7d4ff6ff841cf34e9f/Obscura/Assets/Scripts/TerrainGenerator.cs#L6).

You should replay any **bold text** with your relevant information. Liberally use the template when necessary and appropriate.
